Provides a native implementation of the scrypt algorithm invented by Colin Percival for usage in Universal Windows Platform applications, managed by a C# wrapper. Implements both x86-64 and ARM vector operations for compatibility across platforms.

Usage:

If the parameters are known, simply create an instance of the Scrypt object and use DeriveKey() to run the algorithm.

CreateOptimal() can be used to create an instance of the algorithm conforming to the desired memory and time constraints.
